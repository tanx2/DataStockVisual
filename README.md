For the first time only:: When you will run the project(sqlModel) it will create records inside the database one by one so it may take some time. If it shows 404/Error page at any point press reload!

Challenges I faced:
- The pythonanywhere had an issue connecting json to mysql due to some issue called json fixture.
- Chartjs has upgraded recently which changed the structure of it which made it the visualization challenging
- Learn and applying within a massive time constraint as I was outside the city when I received the email
- Django do not support static file support
- Using virtual environment for the first time which created issue with vs code's python version selection

What did I learn:
- I learnt the ajax call which I did with Fetch or Axios in React
- How the overall backend processes work
- How backend can be connected to UI
